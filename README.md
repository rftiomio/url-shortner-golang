## URL Shortner (Go)

<b>Description: </b> This project was done to solve a classic "System Design" problem/question. Apart from that, additional things that were done in this project: 
web server with proper API routing, custom short url from user, multistage docker file to reduce image etc.

<b>Tech Stack:</b> 
<ul> <li> Golang </li>
<li> Gin Framework</li>
<li>  Redis </li> 
<li>  Docker </li> 
</ul>


<b>TODO: </b>
  - Deploy to ECS and configure API gateway (AWS)
  - Add database to store urls for longer period (RDS or DynamoDB)
  - Get a short domain from Route53 (aws) and configure it.
  - Build a proper pipeline for the deployment process.
